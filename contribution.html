<p>In this section I will describe my main contirbutions to this proejct. As mentioned previously, this project had been split up such that team members are able to work in parallel. As a result, I focused on the tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating the <a href="http://40.83.221.86/inst/global_dashboard/?dash=video&amp;course=psyc1">Video Dashboard</a></li>
<li>Creating the <a href="http://40.83.221.86/inst/global_dashboard/?dash=general&amp;course=psyc1">General Demographics Dashboard</a></li>
<li>Integrating different dashboards together using <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html">Shiny Modules</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describe the approach taken to tackle each of the tasks listed above.</p>
<div id="video-dashboard" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Video Dashboard</h2>
<p>Instructors are often curious as to how students are engaging with their videos. As a result, we have created a video dashboard in which instructors can use to answer key questions about how students are using their videos.</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://40.83.221.86/inst/global_dashboard/?dash=video&amp;course=psyc1">click here</a> to see the video dashboard</p>
<div id="data-cleaning-pipeline" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Data Cleaning Pipeline</h3>
<p>The data cleaning pipeline is necessary in order to populate each course with the appropriate data needed to display the video dashboard.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/diagrams/video_pipeline.png" alt="Video data cleaning pipeline" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:vid_pipe)Video data cleaning pipeline
</p>
</div>
<p>The figure above shows the data cleaning pipeline for video data. Raw track log and video data is initially stored in Google BigQuery. It is downloaded and cleaned programatically through the <code>populate_courses.py</code> script. Next, the cleaned <code>wrangled_video_heat.csv</code> file is used to generate the video visualizations. Of the above diagram, I had specifically made the two SQL scripts (<code>generalize_video_heat.sql</code>/<code>generalized_video_axis.sql</code>) as well as the video wrangling script <code>wrangle_video.R</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="visualization-reasoning-and-caveats" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Visualization Reasoning and Caveats:</h3>
<p>In this section, we show the visualizations within the video dashboard as well as the question that they intend to answer for instructors. Additionally, reasonings and caveats are provided with respect to the design decisions made.</p>
<div id="which-of-my-videos-is-watched-the-most" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2.1</span> Which of my videos is watched the most?</h4>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/visualizations/video/how_long_video.png" alt="Videos are colored by the number of views" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:vid_most)Videos are colored by the number of views
</p>
</div>
<p>The main purpose of the plot above is to gain the trust of the instructor. Intuitively, instructors will already know that videos that occur later in the course are going to have less students because students are more likely drop the course. This allows instructors to trust what is put in front of them by seeing something that is intuitively correct. Additionally, this plot is a good introductory to the next plot. Initially, during usability testing, when showing the heat map plot below without showing the length of video plot above, instructors felt overwhelmed and had trouble interpreting the visualization.</p>
</div>
<div id="which-part-of-my-videos-are-being-watched-the-most" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2.2</span> Which part of my videos are being watched the most?</h4>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/visualizations/video/hot_spots.png" alt="Video segments are colored by the watch rate" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:vid_heat)Video segments are colored by the watch rate
</p>
</div>
<p>The heat map plot above shows which parts of the video are being viewed the most. The “watch rate” of each segment is calculated by the following equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{Watch Rate} = (\frac{\text{Number of times a segment has been watched}}{\text{Number of unique students who have started the video}})\]</span> In the above calculation of the watch rate, the “number of times a segment has been watched” is the raw count regardless of uniqueness of the user. This means that is a new user watches a video segment twice, the “number of times a segment has been watched” will increase by two.</p>
<p>Technically, this was the most difficult plot to make amongst the ones I had worked with. Both the wrangling and visualization of the data went through many iterations in order for it to perform adequately once we had <strong>scaled up</strong> to use all of the data from each course as well as once we had <strong>scaled out</strong> to generalize to a variety of different courses.</p>
</div>
<div id="which-part-of-my-videos-are-students-watching-up-until" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2.3</span> Which part of my videos are students watching up until?</h4>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/visualizations/video/up_until.png" alt="Visualization showing where the average viewer watches up until" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:vid_until)Visualization showing where the average viewer watches up until
</p>
</div>
<p>The plot above was created as a request from usability testing. This shows the average maximum time that a users reach in a video.</p>
</div>
<div id="which-video-segments-have-abnormally-high-or-low-watch-rates" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2.4</span> Which video segments have abnormally high or low watch rates?</h4>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="img/visualizations/video/linear_model.png" alt="Visualization highlighting segments with abnormally high and low watch rates" width="75%" />
<p class="caption">
(#fig:vid_lm)Visualization highlighting segments with abnormally high and low watch rates
</p>
</div>
<p>The plot above shows instructors which segments have abnormally high and low watch rates. It works by creating a linear model used to predict the watch rate of a given segment. The linear model is based on the video’s occurrence in the course as well as the segment’s position within the video. Once the predicted value has been calculated, segments with the highest and lowest residuals are highlighted.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary-table" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2.5</span> Summary table</h4>

<p class="caption">
(#fig:vid_tbl)Example of output table included in dashbaord
</p>
</div>
<p>The table above shows much of the information already displayed in the visualizations above. During usability testing, it was discovered that users often want to see the actual numbers as well as the visualizations.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="general-demographics-dashboard" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> General Demographics Dashboard</h2>
<p>Instructors are also interested on finding how who their students are. Particularly, instructors want to know basic demographic information such as level of education, location, and language. As a result, we have made the “General Demographics Dashboard”.</p>
<p>Please <a href="http://40.83.221.86/inst/global_dashboard/?dash=general&amp;course=psyc1">click here</a> to see the General Demographics Dashboard.</p>
<div id="data-cleaning-pipeline-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Data Cleaning Pipeline</h3>

<p class="caption">
(#fig:gen_pipe)Visualization of general demographics data cleaning pipeline
</p>
</div>
<p>The figure above shows the data cleaning pipeline for demographics data. Raw student demographics data is initially stored in Google BigQuery. It is downloaded and cleaned programatically through the <code>populate_courses.py</code> script. Next, the cleaned <code>wrangle_demographics.csv</code> file is used to generate the video visualizations.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the data obtained through the use of <code>generalized_demographics.sql</code> and <code>rbq.py</code> is not the entire dataset of students. Instead, only students with a known IP address are obtained. This was done because IP address is used to infer statistics such as country and language. Please see <code>generalized_demographics.sql</code> for details.</p>
</div>
<div id="visualization-reasoning-and-caveats-1" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Visualization Reasoning and Caveats:</h3>
<p>In this section, we show the visualizations within the general demographics dashboard as well as the question that they intend to answer for instructors. Additionally, the reasoning that went into their design as well as the caveats that go along with those decisions are provided.</p>

<p class="caption">
(#fig:gen_loc)Visualization of the location of learners
</p>
</div>
<p>The plot above shows the top ten countries according to the number of students enrolled. Student’s country is inferred from their IP addresses within the variable <code>cc_by_ip</code>. This was done because the variable <code>countryLabel</code> available in the <code>person_course</code> BigQuery table is relatively sparse compared to <code>cc_by_ip</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-languages-do-my-students-speak" class="section level4">

<p>The plot above shows the top ten languages according to the number of students that speak it. The students’ language is inferred from their country which is in turn, inferred from their IP address.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The plot above shows the distribution of ages amongst the learners. It should be noted that all ages less than 5 and greater than 100 have been filtered out. This was done because their are often fake accounts that entered a year of birth such that their age would be 200 or greater. As a result, the histogram would be difficult to read.</p>

<div id="dashboard-integration" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Dashboard Integration</h2>
<p>Lastly, all of the different dashboards were required to be combined in such a way that they could all be ran on a single Shiny server. To combine the different dashboards, <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html">Shiny Modules</a> was used such that the work that everyone did could be organized into “modules” and easily combined.</p>
