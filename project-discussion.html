<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Project Discussion</h1>
<p>This section aims to describe the main problem of the project as well as the strength and weaknesses of our solution and strategy.</p>
<div id="problem-description-and-suitability" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Problem Description and Suitability</h2>
<p>The main problem of this project was to help instructors gain actionable insights into their courses by answering key questions. This problem is very well suited as a data science challenge and the skills gained throughout the Master of Data Science program have prepared us to produce a suitable solution.</p>
<p>Although there had already existed an edX dashboard, instructors were not using it very much as they found it either difficult to use or not very useful. However, through usability testing, it was discovered that previous iterations of edX dashboards failed to allow instructors to answer key questions about their courses for a number of reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Instructors were not using the dashboard because it was located on a website separate from the edX website.</li>
<li>Instructors were often required to manually “drill down” and click a large number of times before seeing any interesting statistics about their course elements such as the number of students who got a questions correct. This caused a lot of frustration amongst instructors as they had a hard time performing simple tasks such as finding the most difficult question in their course.</li>
<li>Instructors often had to find problematic course elements themselves. For example, in order to find their least viewed video, instructors would have to click through all of their videos before being able to identify which was the offending video</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, through discussions with one of the project supervisors Ido Roll, it was discovered that the key questions that instructors often had about their courses included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are my students? (General demographics)</li>
<li>What is the overall structure of my course?</li>
<li>How are students engaging with my videos?</li>
<li>How are students performing on the problems?</li>
<li>How are students interacting with the forums?</li>
</ul>
<p>From the insights gained from usability testing and these key questions, we were well situated to begin developing the next iteration of the edX dashboard.</p>
</div>
<div id="suitability-and-availability-of-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Suitability and Availability of Data</h2>
<p>The main source of our data were the web-logs produced by the web traffic of learners on the edX platform stored on Google BigQuery. Almost all interactions of the learners were tracked and recorded. These interactions include events such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a student signs in or out</li>
<li>When a student presses play/pause/stop/fast-forward/etc on a video</li>
<li>When a student attempts a problem</li>
<li>When a student posts on a discussion forum</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to note that the list above is non-comprehensive and is only a very small subset of the different events that are being tracked. The data described above is very well suited</p>
</div>
<div id="strengths-and-weaknesses-of-solution" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Strengths and Weaknesses of Solution</h2>
<p>Please <a href="http://40.83.221.86/inst/global_dashboard/?dash=video&amp;course=psyc1">click here</a> to see the video dashboard.</p>
<p>The implemented solution linked to above was purposed to directly address the points listed in the previous sections. Our solution first provides instructors an overview of a key question, and secondly, it highlights elements that instructors are most likely interested in. The strengths of this solution include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The instructor has a better idea of their course with regard to their key question overall</li>
<li>The instructor no longer has to find problematic course elements themselves such as problems in which students have performed poorly on</li>
<li>The instructor no longer has to perform a large number of clicks before being able to find certain statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>Although our dashboard addresses many of the issues that arose during usability testing, it also comes with a few drawbacks. The main disadvantage of our solution is that although the dashboard is interactive, it does not allow for much room for the instructors for self exploration. In an effort to keep our dashboard simple, we have chosen key statistics to highlight to the instructor instead of allowing them to choose. For example, our dashboard highlights segments of videos that have abnormally high or low <strong>watch rates</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\text{Raw number of views a segment has}}{\text{Unique number of students who have started the video}}\)</span>) . Our dashboard does not allow for instructors to instead highlight segments with abnormally high or low <strong>raw number of views</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-strategy-what-went-well-and-poorly" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Project Strategy: What went well and poorly?</h2>
<p>Throughout this project, we aimed to worked as an effective team in order to produce a suitable solution. Our team strategy included many things that led to our success such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split up the project such that different members of the team can be working in parallel</li>
<li>Leveraging the individual strengths of each team member</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://trello.com/">trello</a> to have better coordination by providing transparency into what people are currently working on</li>
<li>Meeting almost every day to work together as a group</li>
<li>Exposing our solution as early as possible to usability testing</li>
<li>Creating a timeline <strong>and sticking to it</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, this project went smoothly and it is difficult to point to any one thing that went poorly. One obstacle that was encountered is that we found ourselves having many meetings with our client which could have been reduced in number and condensed down into much shorter meetings.</p>
